## Presentation
**Equinox Talk Abstract**: Creating Business Value Through a Unified Observability Platform: Equinox’s Journey to Brand and Tooling Consolidation - Joel Miller (Director of Platform Engineering @ Equinox)

*Equinox began the pandemic as a company with multiple distinct brands with different sets of tools and processes separating the digital at-home and physical in-club member experiences. In late 2021, an overarching company-wide goal was formed to merge the brands and associated teams into a single entity.*

*This talk explores how Equinox managed to democratize access to critical performance data insights to enable all team members to collaborate more effectively using a common framework and dramatically reduce associated platform costs by utilizing Elastic and other open-source tools. We’ll explore the process, architecture, outcomes, and lessons learned from the journey.*

**Elastic Talk Abstract**: Unifying Your Monitoring with Full Stack Observability - David Hope (Principal Product Marketing Director @ Elastic)

*Are you tired of managing multiple, fragmented monitoring tools that provide only partial visibility into your systems? Do you wish you could get a holistic view of your entire stack in one place? Full stack observability can help you achieve this by providing a single pane of glass for monitoring all aspects of your systems, including infrastructure, application performance, and business metrics.*

*In this talk, we will explore the benefits of full stack observability and how it can help you make informed decisions about your systems. We'll also discuss strategies for migrating from multiple, siloed monitoring tools to a unified observability platform. Whether you're just starting to think about observability or you're ready to take the plunge, this talk will provide actionable insights for improving the visibility and reliability of your systems.*
